[Abacus](https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abacus.html) is a N-body code.

Products: 
- [AbacusSummit](https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a suite of cosmological N-body simulations run with the Abacus code. It is also named after the computer used to run the code, Summit. The simulations cover a range of cosmological parameters. Most of them are in 2Gpc/h boxes with 6912^3 particles.
- [AbacusPNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10881) is a suite of cosmological N-body simulations run with the Abacus code, started by the initial condition with local PNG.

## Abacus Utilities

The [Abacus Utilities](https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a set of Python tools to read and analyze AbacusSummit data products.

Include:
- AbacusHOD: run Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models on AbacusSummit halo catalogs to produce mock galaxy catalogs.
- ... more to be added.
