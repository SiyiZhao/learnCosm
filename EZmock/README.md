# EZmock 

[EZmock](https://github.com/cheng-zhao/EZmock) is a code to generate fast mock. The main purpose of EZmock is to facilitate covariance estimation with a large number of mocks.

## Modes to run EZmock

`EZmock` supports 2 kinds of inputs:
1. linear power spectrum (`klin`, `plin` at arbitrary redshift `z_pk`), it will use this to generate a density field with the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA) and then populate tracers with the effective model.
2. displacment field (`dx`, `dy`, `dz`), it will use this to populate tracers with the effective model. 

Additionally, `EZmock` requires cosmological parameters to compute growth factors and other quantities.

### Displacement field

Here we show an example of generating the displacement field with 2LPT, please refer to `run_disp.sh`.

The scripts require a modified version of 2LPT code, which will appear in GitHub soon, for now, please contact me for access.

## Calibrate EZmock

`EZmock` has some free parameters to be calibrated with a reference simulation or observation. Refer to `cali_EZmock.ipynb` for an example.

## Fit EZmock parameters

Or we could fit the effective model parameters by sampling. The codes will appear soon. [TBD]

## Generate EZmocks

Mocks generated by `EZmock` are also called 'EZmocks'.
